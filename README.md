# University Exercises

This is a set of simple projects that I had to build as I pursuit my Computer Engineering degree at UFSC.
It includes a variety of languages and contexts, from low-level programming to web development and machine learning.

# Caveat
Many of these projects are 5+ years old, dating from 2018. The commits dates aren't accurate, as these were private projects that I'm progressively incorporating into this repo.
Therefore, it's necessary to keep a note that I was beginning my programming journey back then, and a lot of code here might be missing best practices, design patterns, clean code, SOLID, DRY, etc.
